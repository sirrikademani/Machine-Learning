Don't do anything that you weren't asked to do.

Or let's say $6/3 miles to an area with tough parking during a slow hour when you know damn well nothing better is coming. Some decline those but you'd have to take something like that. You could make it in 2.5-3 weeks if you made it your life and your market allowed it. Less if you micro-manage. Rice and beans, beans and rice. As Dave Ramsey says. Just don't expect it to tickle.

ppl should tip tho and if they dont have it they shouldnt be ordering out.

And its not just a doordash issue. I used to work at a pizza place 10 years ago and we had some notorious no tippers. We would purposely deliver their food late. And once a driver took $5 out of the money the guy gave him for the food and told the owner that the guy stiffed him. The owner ended up putting that customer on the do not serve list.

Food tampering is never ok but also rule #1 of the food service industry is you shouldnt be rude to the ppl who handle your food and not tipping your driver is pretty rude",/r/doordash/comments/11xaest/im_sorry_but_this_is_a_little_ridiculous/jd2k0dx/

Ordering food is a privilege, and throwing 5$ on top isn't a big deal. These people purposefully don't tip, and they aren't doing it because they don't have the money

They hurt people in many ways. You might think oh, it's harmless, no tip, which it does seem not to be a big deal.... these people are absolutely malicious to others, they are rude, ungrateful, scare people, leave the lights off purposefully, claim their food didn't arrive, leave their dogs out when they know the driver is coming, give negatives when you went above and beyond for them, yell at people, purposefully don't put their apartment # and dont respond when people are trying to find their place, try to get people fired, etc.

2. Since you‚Äôre an ex dasher, you yourself know that the solid majority of our pay comes from tips. Whether we like to talk about it or not, the only way that this job is worth the time and effort and the only way to make a profit is if people continue to tip well. It‚Äôs just how this system works. If you don‚Äôt support tips or can‚Äôt afford them, then do not use this system. Simple as that.
3. Fast food and kitchen/culinary jobs in general are difficult. They‚Äôre fast pace high stress environments. But at the end of the day, that is the job that those employees signed up to do. As a dasher and basically a coworker, I have a right to complain about my acquaintance‚Äôs performance because it effects my money. Again as you know, we are not paid hourly (it‚Äôs not offered in my area yet atleast). When we‚Äôre waiting 10, 15, 20 minutes for an order, that costs us money. A quick order may take just 10 - 20 minutes to complete. And since nobody is reimbursing me for my lost wages and time, the best thing to do is to complain. Write a google review like I do about crappy restaurant experiences as a dasher. Tell your local Facebook groups or subreddits. Hold these places accountable if you have consistent bad issues and things will change. I‚Äôve seen it a bunch of times in my area. But those stories are a bit long for this post.
4. I actually agree with you on this one. The dasher accepted the order, didn‚Äôt unassign from the stack, and sabotaged the order. Shame on them. 
5. The point I‚Äôm trying to make is complaining is really the only power we have. If we don‚Äôt complain, we‚Äôre just going to get walked over. Speak up for yourselves. I wish other employees in other workplaces could be so upright and honest about their work like we are. We have that right because we have no boss to kiss their butt or worry about getting fired. Complaining enables positive change and to hold our customers and vendors accountable. They get the same right too.",/r/doordash/comments/11xaest/im_sorry_but_this_is_a_little_ridiculous/jd2uuu1/

Poor people don‚Äôt use delivery. Im talking real poor. The type poor that the roaches ate better than us.

My point isn‚Äôt a disagreement more than it‚Äôs a change in perception in how people see can‚Äôt afford to as opposed to truly not having it.

DoorDash charges fees/taxes and people in poverty can‚Äôt afford such a luxury.

The other side of this is the driver uses gas, tires and maintenance to deliver to customers who aren‚Äôt paying for drivers to eat or take care of their families. It‚Äôs unfair to have empathy for the customers claiming not enough money but be dismissive of drivers trying to make extra money. 

It‚Äôs not complaining more than hurt drivers are displaying. I‚Äôve gotten $100-$250 orders and higher people didn‚Äôt tip. As low as a frosty from Wendy‚Äôs I once delivered DoorDash added base pay to because customer didn‚Äôt tip. They paid $6 in fees and taxes for a frosty! That‚Äôs not poor people activities.

I understand handicapped people using the app( I give them a pass tip or not as I‚Äôve delivered to them. I get it). That‚Äôs my lone exception with elderly folks.

We should not lose respect based on not having enough. Why mistreat another lacking for my gain? So my point is, why punish someone struggling trying to make extra money or rent or car payment. Just get it yourself if you know ppl depend on tips.

Are you wrong OP? No but often even drivers don‚Äôt support each other the way they should. 

Drivers drive to the merchant, wait for the orders (5-30+ minutes) and then drive to the customer and drop off in rain, sleet or snow. Hot or cold windy or foggy. Delivery is a luxury not a necessity. 

Tipping isn‚Äôt a courtesy. It‚Äôs a reflection of who you are. Kind, respectful or generous or all. Not tipping the opposite.

Non tippers hurt acceptance rates. Lower the score the worse the orders. They stack those orders and if you kindly deliver them. Most often they are rude and give 1 star ratings. Complaining isn‚Äôt about not being paid alone. It‚Äôs the lying they didn‚Äôt get the order and 1 star ratings that make those deliveries Hades level. They hurt when you accept them and decline.

99,jd35mnj,AZDoorDasher,3/21/2023 7:38,t1_jd2p3al,11xaest,I‚Äôm sorry but this is a little ridiculous.,"I agree.  The real problem is DD.  Yes, there are buttheads that don‚Äôt tip.  However, it is my point that some people don‚Äôt tip or tipped low is because of DD.

They market that drivers are making $26 per hour.  The UE CEO was on CNBC saying that drivers are making $40 per hour.  Personally, I have encountered friends and customers who thought I was being paid an hourly wage.

I think that most customers will be aghast to learn that a driver is only paid $2.00 to $3.00 per delivery while the customer paid a 20-30% premium plus a levy of fees.

When was the last time you tipped your Amazon, DHL, FedEx, UPS or USPS driver?  They are paid an hourly wage.

Are we waiters or drivers?  We are drivers!  We don‚Äôt work for the restaurants but how many customers expect us to make sure that their food is cooked a certain way, have certain items on them, etc?  We take food from Pt A to Pt B.

Again, the real problem is DD.  They should require a minimum delivery fee (100% to the driver) or charge a minimum amount for a delivery.  Of course, this is against the best interest of DD.

DD only cares about the 20-30% commissions that they receive from the restaurants and the fees that they charge the customers.  They don‚Äôt care a rat ass about the dashers.",/r/doordash/comments/11xaest/im_sorry_but_this_is_a_little_ridiculous/jd35mnj/

On top of all that why do people get mad at customers who are already paying 1-2 dollars more per item while doordash pockets all this. Stop this driver vs customer I‚Äôm sure if doordash food prices matched in store prices people may tip a few dollars but sadly everyone is blinded by the truth because they expect others to pick up the slack when they weren‚Äôt promised none of that. If the job said guaranteed  tip I‚Äôd understand but since it doesn‚Äôt people should just accept or deny and don‚Äôt complain. It‚Äôs like saying u wanna be a boxer but don‚Äôt like being punched. Better example u know how many people go to a restaurant, dine in and not tip. People need to stop acting like things are so different then before, only difference is instead of service at the table ur adding the service to home, which again relates to what I was saying doordash was a innovation to eliminate delivery drivers  so again I stand by what I say, doordash drivers need to honestly make a union and I don‚Äôt mean just doordash. I mean all delivery people and companies. I worked for doordash and clearly I wasn‚Äôt being paid enough for my time so I quit, but I understand some can only do this job or actually enjoy this job. honestly ur complaint about a customer who may have money to spare or not won‚Äôt change anything when company‚Äôs are pocketing billions and pretty much enslaving a bunch of drivers. Drivers instead need to figure out a way to unite because in all honesty with all new innovations people try lobbying until they can‚Äôt anymore.

150,jd3fxrs,Souvenirs_Indiscrets,3/21/2023 8:47,t1_jd305qb,11xaest,I‚Äôm sorry but this is a little ridiculous.,"DoorDash is a luxury. 

It has been subsidized thus far to create consumer demand. 

In California there has been some adjustment for the real cost of driver labor, this is developing further in New York, and watching all this carefully, industry analysts have predicted that driver costs will have to go up if the industry is to survive. When the music stops, this is a luxury business model and it will be priced beyond the means of many if not most current customers. 

The problem is, if DoorDash and others don‚Äôt move quickly to make today‚Äôs understandably disgruntled customers feel confident that their orders are being handled by responsible and professional couriers, they will erode more than just their own stock prices. They‚Äôll erase the whole industry they built. 

That‚Äôs not going to happen. At least Steve Case and others were able to exit with dignity from AOL. These new gig economy guys did not ‚Äúinnovate‚Äù to drive their own careers into the grave. 

Those who talk about air drone service really have been smoking too much. Federal control over public airspace prevents commercial flying objects below a 500 foot ceiling without a license, usually given only to researchers with institutional affiliations and insurance, and that‚Äôs never going to change. Air safety is a program jointly administered by the military and after watching those Chinese weather balloons on the evening news, there is no way Congress can get both sides to agree on doing away with those airspace laws. Not in this country anyway. 

Ground robot service‚Äîare you kidding? Why not just walk through the rough streets of your city flaunting a Burkin (luxury handbag)? You don‚Äôt think there won‚Äôt be a fleet of unmarked vans roaming around stealing DoorDash drones at dark and dodgy delivery sites?

Students accept the reality that they need to step outside in their pajamas to take the orders I deliver to their dorms. But everybody else wants doorstep service. To their front porches, their hotel rooms, their fourth story walk up  apartments. So: how‚Äôs that going to work with ground based drones? 

Maybe it will be a hit in Florida retirement communities or Sun City Phoenix but beyond that, I don‚Äôt think so.

In many areas dashers can no longer get in the schedule so this is a reality for far too many. 

With tips it doubles to about 15 per hour minimum averaged over a year. Better dashers making 17-22 an hour reliably. FT taking home probably a minimum of 500 a week with tips. Without tips your calculation is probably correct for too many dashers. Their dashing probably bring in same amount per hour as the W2 available to them. But of course dashing is too expensive, so they quit. 

But for whatever reason, people need to earn income with the flexibility that this work offers. Very few W2s compare. That‚Äôs why long term couriers keep rolling and why long term dashers want to keep dashing.

So the minimum bare minimum is a buck or two since that‚Äôs what gas would have cost you. Time is too ambiguous. My time is worth more than yours? Lol ok? How would you actually unitize that? What scale? So you can‚Äôt. You can probably maybe unitize polite behavior or followed instructions or something, so that‚Äôs another dollar or two. But contactless drop off does not require any contact or polite behavior. So that doesn‚Äôt really work anymore either.

And then the delivery wage DD pays is more the ‚Äúdoing your job‚Äù part like getting out of your car and bringing to door, pickup etc. The customer isn‚Äôt tipping for that. They are mainly just compensating on your gas or difficulty of the drive I suppose. Maybe a little for overall car maintenance but again that is really vague on what that would actually be per delivery. A few cents? Who knows.

No. Knock. It's the standard. It always has been. Not everyone lives on their phone. Not everyone even orders with a phone.

On the other hand if I place an order through DoorDash and there‚Äôs a problem, I know that their support will either have new food sent out to me or give me credits available immediately on my account so I can place a new order.  

I started using the merchant apps because many of them offer rewards points toward free food. But now I only use it if I‚Äôm doing a pick up order so that I can check the food right away and go back inside if it‚Äôs wrong.",/r/doordash/comments/11xjtv8/my_dasher_knocked_on_my_door_after_being_told_to/jd4yxo6/

599,jd0jr9p,Not-Noah,3/20/2023 16:19,t3_11wzc8x,11wzc8x,Dasher Vs. Dasher,"Well first off I hope when you signed up for insurance you got the special commerical type that allows you to do DD and still get coverage... Because if you told your insurance that you were doing DD and you don't have that then you're all sorts of fucked. They probably won't cover anything and they'll most likely drop you from being able to get insurance from them. If you do have that (unlike most dashers) though then all that's gonna happen is you might get an increase in your monthly premiums and everything will be chill. Overall I DEFINITELY recommend you don't say SHIT about working for DD to any insurance company (yours or theirs) because it can get much more complicated much more quickly even if you have the proper policy.


As for the DD part though, nah I wouldn't worry about telling them anything. Unless you're hurt on the job then there's no reason to talk to them about that shit. At best they'll just be like ""Ok cool... Anything else?"", and at worst they might think ""Oh this person is a liability so let's just get rid of them"" (this is very unlikely to be the case but who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

Edit: also I'd cover for the other driver and not say they were doing DD at the time just in case they don't have that type of insurance I was talking about earlier. They probably won't even ask so just don't mention it.

I like to think of it as a conveyor belt of orders. Each one you accept is a box on the belt and pushes the 100th order off the belt.

If you decline 5 in a row and those 5 blank spots without boxes are on the belt, the blank space will travel down the belt so it says 95 the entire time. If you only do 50 orders and then decline 1 more, there e is still the original 5 blank spots, and 1 new blank spot so it says 94.

You can keep doing order and it won't go up to 95 again I til the first of the blank spots rolls off the end of your belt

I hope that makes sense.

You can track it yourself if you bring a piece of graph paper with you and make columns of 10 orders to make it easy to read. Put a 1 in each box you accept and a zero if you decline. After you fill the 11th row, cross off the first. That way you can always see your last 100 offers and how many you accepted or declined quickly if you need to.

Why would you want some random to have your buzzer anyway?,"Coming from a dasher who also lives in an apartment complex, here's my take. Yes the customer should put clear instructions on how to get to their apartment. It makes life SOO much easier and for me when I order from doordash I have a tiny paragraph of where exactly I'm located. But forcing them to come down to the lobby is a little much. Specifically my apartment complex doesn't have a lobby, just a leasing office. I've had dashers ask if I can meet them down by there. The thing is, I live on the opposite side of the complex. That is a ridiculous walk to ask for anyone to make. If I'm paying you a tip and I'm asking to leave it at my door, then I shouldn't have to hike to get my food. But yeah.

For one thing, I paid a big upcharge and a tip so I don't have to put a bra and shoes on and go outside. It's called DOOR dash because I paid for someone to bring it to the DOOR. Not the lobby and DEFINITELY not the parking lot!

Also, they are basically asking me, a smallish woman, to go meet them at their car in the apartment parking lot at night. Uhh, absolutely not. Even if the driver isn't sketchy who says the other randos in the parking lot aren't? 

A few days ago I had a driver beg me for more money when I already left a big tip, and when I said no, they left my food ON THE SIDEWALK outside the apartment building. Wtf??

One driver left the food on the ground next to an unoccupied desk on the ground floor (the hotel lobby was another floor up and this was a space used just to enter building off street,) then send a picture of a close up of the bag.

I dont care if its an apt or a house or a hotel - if there are instructions that can help the food get there easier and faster, that is the best for both the driver & the customer. I dont know why both sides wouldnt want the smoothest delivery possible.

Why would you want some random to have your buzzer anyway?,"There‚Äôs a couple of things you need to take into consideration here. Not even taking the tip into consideration, the customer has already paid significantly inflated prices for their food to be delivered to their door. Most restaurants charge an additional 30% compared to their normal menu pricing, so there‚Äôs probably a good reason why the customer has resorted to ordering delivery vs getting it themselves.

That being said, you don‚Äôt know the exact reason why someone ordered delivery and you shouldn‚Äôt just assume anyone who isn‚Äôt disabled is able to just pop down to the lobby at a moment‚Äôs notice. It‚Äôs not the estimated delivery time is always accurate. The customer could be tied up in a meeting working from home, taking care of a sleeping infant or multiple children that can‚Äôt be left by themselves, etc.

Last of all, it can also be a safety issue. Maybe not so much if you‚Äôre asking to meet at the lobby, but I‚Äôve had instances where drivers have asked me to meet them outside late at night and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm simply not comfortable doing. Ultimately as a customer, if I‚Äôve paid premium prices for my food, I would like to not be inconvenienced in any way because I paid extra for the convenience of it being delivered to my door.",/r/doordash/comments/11wwf3s/people_who_live_in_apartments_should_not_force/jd1vaue/

In most cities with more suburban sprawl apartments have the setup this commenter described, being a series of building spread across a larger property. 

I've lived in apartments where the leasing office was across the street from my section of the property and one where it was actually faster for me to go get my car from the garage and drive there. OP's idea has merit but I think the markets where it could work are pretty narrow and not guaranteed to always provide the best customer experience. 

And if the customer has a bad experience it increases the chance that they don't tip, causing the dasher to have a bad experience too.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Folks throw around all these rules that they follow and for the most part $1.00 a mile is a good one just for cost benefit sake but I couldn't do $2 a mile always.

For instance I'll take a $12 for 10 miles most days. Most folks here wouldn't do that because it's not enough  cash. I drive a hybrid for the gas milage. That will be highway miles for sure so it will be quick miles and I'll 'most' of the time (like 75%) get something decent on the return. My goal is $20+ an hour and I easily make that almost always. Saturday it was $30+ an hour. 

I think some of these 'rules' on this sub do not work for most drivers and they certainly don't woek for me and I feel like I do well. At least for my market. 

Best to just experiment and see what works for YOU.

Edit: those downvoting must work in a big market city. Here most good tippers are 10-15 miles outside of the delivery area.

Rapidly expanding was the only way they were able to keep pulling investors, but now that they‚Äôre running out of places to expand and still can‚Äôt turn profit, shareholders are going to start pulling out. Hence why they cut base pay 33% at the end of 2021 when everyone else was getting inflation raises.

Also why they‚Äôre flooding the markets with dashers and we‚Äôre seeing less orders despite a some 268% increase in order volume.

That got me a 5.0 customer rating.

In some markets you‚Äôve gotta communicate because customers that scam look for opportunities to claim they never got orders. Establish interactions.

Prior to hand it to me deliveries being handed over if you can screenshot the food in hand with address number in Background holding order so both are in photo. 

Save all screenshots a minimum 7 business days. After 7 days delete those photos older than 7 days as most false claims would‚Äôve already populated by then. 

I use to screenshot everything. 

This Also helps with outages or app issues. If you have the address screenshot prior to a app issue you can still use Waze or other gps to deliver instead of waiting for app to properly function.

In all honesty, I never even look at mine. If I get a 1-star, I don't even know why or when/where I got it from. Since there is nothing I can do to correct what may have gone wrong (often it's not even the driver) I simply do not care to look at all.

All I do is confirm I have the order and all the drinks, read the instructions, and confirm the delivery address when I arrive, and I rarely ever get a bad review.

I don't hate the company but have had a few negative experiences.  Doordash is a company like any other and they're going to seek profits above anything else.

I don't hate the customers.  I've disliked a few so far, but hate is not a description I'd use.  I have also had some great customers, those who help slightly reverse my overall opinion on human beings in general.  I've been in law enforcement for 29 years so it's safe to say I'm a subject matter expert on how bad people can be.

Tipping is a sore subject for anyone who works in a food service field.  The same bad tippers who can look a server in the eye and refuse to tip, those who can consume a meal and bail without paying, and those who look down on servers exist on the app too.  Honestly, there seems to be more good tippers than bad out there.  However,  with Doordash, I believe most people aren't understanding of the Dasher pay aspect.  Doordash already increases the costs of the food so some might think they need to save money.  Some might think that DD pays drivers so they don't rely on tips.  Some places like Papa John's subcontract DD to deliver their pizzas and some customers don't know it.  You can tell because pizza delivery may carry only $1 or $2 cash tip.  

To a Dasher, $2.50 (my area basic pay), isn't remotely enough to drive my own car to pick up someone's food and transport it miles away to someone else.  It's my car, it's maintenance,  my fuel, my time and my energy.

What do you think taxes are? Try not paying taxes and you will get kidnapped and thrown in a jail. Try not paying property taxes and they take your home. All your seeing today is the slavemasters got smart and stopped making it so obvious with whips and chains. They figured out voluntary slavery is easier than forced slavery in past. Harriet Tubman spoke about the people who were slaves but didn't know it. I hope that's not you. Today's slavemasters have you keep your eyes on the past so you don't see the slavery you are living today. How can today not be slavery when you need permission to drive (license) or own a car (registration), cut hair (license), put a toilet in (permit), have a rally to protest something (permit), have a garden (zoning laws), it's endless. I am not trying to down play the horror of our past slaves but it's important people start to see what is going on today in front of your own eyes.",/r/UberEATS/comments/11wh2qc/feeling_like_i_should_start_cancelling_single/jd1bj0s/

No, efficient. An industrious and intelligent use of their money and time, in fact.

If you make $40/hr at your job, and you can pay someone else $20 per hour to shop for you for an hour, you've netted a half hour of free time. You pay someone else less than it would effectively cost you to do the thing yourself, and it's a benefit of wealth to have more free time.

You can call it lazy if it makes you feel better about yourself, but at the end of the day, they're working hard at their jobs to not have to work as hard at chores. That's smart, not lazy.

&#x200B;

the restaurant gets the order exactly the way you placed it. if it's a large chain restaurant, their POS systems are often integrated with UE/DD/ETC. the order goes directly in to their system with no human input. the receipt with your name on it will print, again, with no human input. in this case, the receipt should display exactly what was ordered, regardless of what's in the bag. the only human in this entire process is you. if the order on the receipt IS NOT what you ordered, there was a glitch either in the UE system or an integration issue where  an item was omitted due to the system not recognizing the 1's and 0's for that specific item. 

&#x200B;

in cases where the order is coming from a smaller restaurant(perhaps the local chinese restaurant), the receipt is printed directly from a table that UE provides, again, displaying exactly what you ordered. 

&#x200B;

i have a lot of complaints about UE(and the others) as a driver, but the way the system relays info to the restaurant isn't one of them. the system, if used correctly, is fair more accurate and efficient than ordering your order at the counter.",/r/UberEATS/comments/11w3o0h/drivers_deserve_better/jcwclvj/

2\. PIN orders are messed up because I don't see that the PIN is required until after I drop off the food. I do usually see customer notes, it's not like I'm not looking at my phone. I hand it to them, they leave, only then does it become apparent a PIN is needed.  

3\. Bug: where the app is running in the background, an order comes in and you go to look at it, and there's no way to accept it. You get a trace of the route and no accept button.  

4\. Hiding the destination on the map for add-on offers and stacked orders. Then if you try to switch to google maps to enter the route it deliberately blocks the address field on google maps.  

5\. Lying about distance for addon and stacked orders. Sometimes it seems correct, sometimes it seems to be lying. If it ever claims an addon is ""0 miles"" it's lying to you.  

----  

I don't know why Uber drains your battery more than other apps, they're all equally bad for me - screen on 100% of the time, gps running, data transfer every couple of second - it's going to drain the phone.  

For \#2 it is very annoying, but there's some hard-to-find ways to turn all this behavior off.  

No issue with Trip Radar for me. Offers are usually lame and ignored but it's not a huge deal.

Someone who commutes 3-4 hours a day 5 days a week will spend more time on the road then a gig worker who drives a couple of hours per day 3-5 days a week. No one asks ‚Äúwhat are you doing, where were you going‚Äù when in an accident. Why would you bring it up?

It's part of the job. I get a ping about 80% of the time right before I make the last turn onto the customer's street, or like 70% of the time as I'm driving past a highway on-ramp. It seems incredibly unlikely that any lawsuit would prove fruitful unless a class-action emerges and Uber gets subpoenaed--but even then, I dunno how ""intellectual property"" is handled with modern stuff like apps, since the evidence that they're intentionally creating unsafe driving conditions would lie in the code itself, right? And for surface-level stuff like the ""trip radar,"" they can just say that we could've stopped using their app at any time, I'd imagine. IANAL obviously lmao, fingers crossed of course, but don't get your hopes up for a big payout or changes that benefit us. When trip radar goes away, it will be because it's proven itself to be unprofitable, and you can bet it'll be replaced with something much worse.

Not to get too into the legal stuff, but Negligence has 4 elements, duty, breach of duty, cause, and injury/harm.
I'd say it comes down to if a court believes Uber has a duty to make the app safe for drivers and if they breached the duty with the trip radar's extreme incentivization.

The optimist and anti-capitalist in me hopes a jury would determine Uber at least 20% at fault.

I'm not a lawyer either, but I did go to law school and just took the bar exam. Hopefully, I can say I am one very soon. But all I know is scenarios on tests. Don't know real-life situations and how things actually go down in court. I could very well be foolishly hoping for the best.

It said I earned $19.77 then shows they paid me $4.46, today I get one and it was only for $2.26. I went to check my Uber pro card and I did got 4 misc. deposits today that equaled $19.77. I sure hope I get more tomorrow because from what I figured I should  probably be getting at least $40-50 more. Last week I did a 15 mile delivery that was a very underpaid fare estimate of only $12, which took me almost 50 minutes deliver. The only reason I took it because it said $27. I'm so happy the guy wasn't tip bating the $15 tip. From my calculations I should have at least gotten at least $16 from the minimum wage guarantee and $4.50 more for the .30 cents per mile. The fare alone should have been $20.50 cents not $12. That should be an extra $8.50 right there. I have had a few these in the past two weeks that were $2-$5 less than I should have been paid.

It's the fact that this wasn't a single order that knows it's a pain to get to his place and tries to offset it by tipping and providing instructions. This was 1 of 3 orders (triple stack for 10$ total) that means this fucker definitely didn't tip and he knows it's a pain in the ass to get to his place. 

That's adding salt to the wounds, if you're not tipping and you have 2 different locked doors and a flight of stairs to go through the least you could do is meet the driver outside.

>The button doesn't say ""Meet at Drivers Car"" because a) Uber has bikers b) it might mean to meet the person outside at the entrance of their office building that doesn't allow delivery drivers/in front of apartment building that requires a key to get in/outside the mall where they work so they don't have to wait while we roam around trying to find ""The Sunglass Spot"" or whatever, etc. 

You don't understand that it would still cause plenty of confusion if it said ""Meet Outside"" on *our* app? There needs to be communication. 

That's why I said ""pretty clear"". I didn't say *totally* clear, I didn't say *crystal* clear, and i never said there was no room for interpretation. I also said that I could understand that there could be confusion. 

If a customer has the option of ""Meet at Door"" and ""Meet Outside"", and they want the order brought to their door...I mean, come on. I know common sense isn't common enough, but seriously. Why would there be both options if they meant the exact same thing? If you *think* it might just mean the same thing, why not pick the option that's more clear, with no room for interpretation?

The only confusion that makes any sense is if the customer thought the courier would meet them in their yard/driveway and wasn't expecting them to be chilling in their car. That's completely understandable.

Your point is taken, but what many Uber customers don't get (because Uber doesn't want to be seen this way) is that personal delivery service is a luxury. It **has** to be. Someone is literally owning and operating their vehicle for the sole purpose of running an errand for you for a certain amount of time.

Yes, some people apply this luxury service to a basic product like a fast food sandwich, as you have, and rightfully question its sustainability. I agree the economics don't work in that scenario, and I personally don't do it.

Delivering a $5 sandwich takes the same amount of time and auto expenses as delivering a $150 sushi order. In fact, fast food like Chick-fil-a actually takes longer on average, given wait times. Unlike waitstaff (and even that to only some degree), it doesn't make sense to tip differently between those orders when it's literally carrying a bag.

Nobody is saying it's hard work to ""drive it 10 minutes."" What we're saying is that there's a minimum threshold we have to make in order to pay our expenses and earn minimum wage (which I'm sure you would agree is not an unreasonable goal). *On average*, that amount amounts to a $2/mile tip from the restaurant to you. That's for an average state's minimum wage and normal IRS rates for mileage expenses (in fact, I use a 25% lower rate than the IRS when doing this calculation).

So is parking (1-2 minutes, usually fighting Chick-fil-a traffic), waiting at the restaurant (10+ minutes at the chick-fil-a where I am), and then the minute or two dropping it off to you, in addition to the driving. So yes, it's like a half hour investment, at least..

To answer your question, I wouldn't think that **anyone** would pay a personal delivery service to have fast food delivered. But here we are.

That's 6 miles or $3 right off the top in expenses before I can start making a penny for my time. That's more than what Uber pays for base.

This is one horrible human being.,"This has happened to me several times but I never thought much of it BUT this one time something happened that nearly questioned my sanity for doing this. Get a regular ping to an ice cream shop, pick up is simple, arrive at guest's house, instructions are ""Leave at door"", so I set the thing down and as I'm fumbling to take the picture because this stupid app always insists on spamming new offers on you just as you're about to finish one, I notice two kids glaring at me through the window and one of them shouts ""ICE CREEAAAMMM"" There are no adults in sight, one of them opens the door and just stares at me, I feel like a jerk just leaving the food there so I finish taking the picture and hand it to the kid. As soon as that happens, their mom shows up (she was on the phone) and yells, ""Uh what are you doing?"" I sheepishly say, ""Uh uber delivery"" and she replies, ""Not to you, I'm talking to my daughter, who told you to open the door for strangers? never do that ever again something bad might happen""...I try to make the situation less awkward and say, ""Your mom is right, but I'm a good stranger who brought you ice cream \*awkward smile\*"" She quickly says thanks then slams the door and I leave feeling like a complete idiot. Apparently the dad was the one who had ordered it and no one in the house knew. That's by far a top 5 weird delivery for me.

I have distance limits for night delivery as well. No more than 3 miles tops in any direction except north. 5 miles otherwise at the most. These limits keep me out of bad neighborhoods but it's not a guarantee. Mainly if I can't picture the area in my head I don't go at all after dark.  That prevents dangerous surprises before they happen like a creepy house at the end of a dark street or something. I also have pepper spray. 

I would say that female drivers should stick to a smaller delivery area both day and night and get to know it very well. It's not only safer but easier. I know all the apartment layouts around here and keep a list of gate codes too. This one place changes the code all the time but their back resident gate is in near constant use so a code isn't needed anyway. When you deliver all the time to the same area you get to know these helpful shortcuts. 

It also helps avoid bad ratings bc I can deliver fast before the food gets cold or the shake melted or whatever. 

If it's super sketch I'd call Uber and tell them it's dangerous and for them  to call the customer to come out and get their order bc I'm not leaving the car. That hasn't happened but it could and if it does that's what I would do.",/r/UberEATS/comments/11x7zms/ubereats_driver_attacked/jd4zb0a/

I don‚Äôt do late night deliveries, bad areas, and try to avoid apartment buildings whenever possible. 

I briefly worked for GoPuff as a driver and they kept trying to send me out to super unsafe areas day and night (you report to a warehouse and are randomly assigned orders). If I refused, supervisors had a problem with it. But as so called independent contractors, we are always within our rights to refuse a delivery for any reason. 

Stopped working for them pretty quickly because I am not risking my life for $6.

I have tried every single one, you have any flavors you like? My current favorite from them bounces between Neapolitan (it‚Äôs SWEET), Razzleberry (blue raspberry), and white gummy bear. All of them are good, though they are sweeter. 300mg and zero sugar, I really like them. 

Another good option is Celsius like others have said, although the only thing I gripe about them is that they have a ‚Äúpowdered drink‚Äù taste to all their flavors. It tastes like if you just mixed your own powdered drink. It isn‚Äôt bad, but it can be off putting to some. 

Monster is good of course, they have a wide range of flavors, especially in their absolute zeros. They just came out with a strawberry cream flavor which I‚Äôm trying today. 

Red Bull is major eh to me. It‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt buy it much. 

Bang is good, although they‚Äôre just like Reign with different flavors. I really like their lemon flavor and champagne flavor, but they‚Äôre hard to find. 

Nerd sucks, that ghost drink thing (yellow can with candy flavors) is GOOD af but it‚Äôs a little sour sometimes and gets me way more hyped than I deserve.

The estimated delivery time didn't change until I contacted customer service and they told me that the delivery time would be updated and they would send me a coupon code. After my driver delivers the food literally 10 minutes later, I noticed that the box which held my burger and fries was opened. Who's to say he didn't take a few fries and spit in it? I was so furious but thankfully I successfully requested a refund.

I'm never ordering anything from more than a 10 minute walk from me--there are literally hundreds of restaurants to choose from in that radius-- and I am a disabled person;  I'm not seeing people in cars even when I do go downstairs to wait for them, and when I pass by the restaurants I order from they usually have people coming and going on bikes.

I don't understand why you're being hostile to me. I have no problem with you or your personal complaint. My question was asked because I do not WANT to do the wrong thing by you or anyone else. If the culture has changed so that I shouldn't be expecting food delivered to my apartment then I don't want to assume people will deliver to my apartment, period, or be mad at them if they don't. It was a simple question--is delivering to an apartment no longer considered a standard or reasonable expectation?

What seems to be a problem for BOTH customers and delivery people is that it has been stated many times here that the DPs don't see the instructions until AFTER they take the job, which is stupid. I order delivery so I don't have to get dressed and walk outside--if I'm already doing that it means I already have enough energy to walk a few blocks to the place I'm ordering from. But it seems to me that if there are DPs who don't want to come in than I should be able to say that's what's required and you should be able to turn me down; that seems to be part of the problem with your complaint as well.

That is so weird, if you offer customers to do that service with the tip they gave, I am sure none of them accept it. 

As a driver let me tell the calculation:

Order distance: 3 miles
Order delivery duration: 20minutes(if restaurant gives the order on timebut they do not usually)

Grubhub gives around $2.85 for distance and $0.05 for your time.As a result you get $3. If you do not tip driver, driver's will get $3 for 40 minutes.

Experienced drivers just don't accept the order until it pays enough, but newer ones might be accepting the order and then realizing it doesn't pay enough and cancelling.",/r/grubhub/comments/x8kcc4/constantly_cancels_orders/iu88px1/

Honestly, the turnover for delivery drivers here is insane(30 mins north of Boston in a mid sized city area). I know maybe 2 drivers from Seamless and Grubhub who have been delivering for more than a month. I order 3 times a week on average. When I lived in Manhattan, and later Brooklyn Heights/Cobble Hill, I tipped 20% with a minimum of $12 unless it was a 4 block or less delivery. I ALWAYS got my food hot and fresh and with a smile. Here I can‚Äôt even get a repeat delivery by someone. 

The business is broken- plain and simple. I‚Äôm just going to go back to doing my own deliveries. My time is worth more than the fees but it‚Äôs less stressful and my food will arrive warm.

If this is happening to you regularly, check your Google maps location and see if it actually leads properly to your house. Because there's absolutely no reason to go into anyone's backyard, or leave any food in the snow unless you don't have a porch awning or roof.

Other than that, I usually find that people who complain chronically about their food service tend to be the problem, not the food service itself.",/r/grubhub/comments/10iy6dw/are_grubhub_drivers_trained_to_ignore_the_include/j5i0p4s/

I will make two points in the drivers defense:

1. We have limited control over what is in your order. *Almost* no control, really, though it depends a bit on the restaurant. At most restaurants, the order is prepared before we arrive, and the bag is sealed so we can't really verify or change the contents. 
2. The general philosophy among drivers and the companies is that it is rarely a good idea to interact with the customer after the order is delivered. Some of the apps don't even deliver messages once the order is delivered (Instacart is that way. Once an order is delivered, you can't contact the customer at all, even if you find something you forgot to deliver in your car). The philosophy is that your best bet is to contact customer service and deal with people who specialize in fixing problems for you. 

Now, that said, your driver was an asshole. She clearly was doing the bare minimum *at best*, and it sounds to me like she didn't even do that much. I'm sorry for your experience.",/r/grubhub/comments/wgmj5a/is_my_outrage_overthetopor_justified/ij0wfj7/

I believe since there was no option, likely means they whatever pie for the day, may be diff depending on the cook and his mood even..

And, if they run out of pie, it will be taken off the drivers side of receipts.

Drivers get ""order accuracy verification"" type receipts.

If no pie on hers, means they never had or gave you pie at all, for many reasons (not done cooking or cooling, inventory issues, personnel issues, management issues, or someone came in and ""a piece of pie for everyone here eating already. And rest for staff on their breaks""

I've seen all these scenario personally as a manager for a restaurant for 10 years.

Basically had she looked at 1) the receipt 2) the delivery instructions that said what kind of pie or 3) the text I sent her while she was waiting for my order about the pie she would have known she was missing pie.

On Ubereats you can choose priority delivery for $1.99-3.99 (usually depends on how close the restaurant is to you*) and your order will be first or among the first if others have selected priority along with you. Your food will and should come faster as well as directly to you with no pauses when you do this option on Uber eats. Also ubereats allows you to tip after the order of is delivered or if someone DOES manage to shockingly pick up your order if you put no tip after you put the order in. You can adjust the tip as it goes and you can pull the tip back and take it away as well.

But when you take the tip back on Uber eats they will make several attempts to have you tip the driver and they will hike the tip suggestion up way higher. This only happened to me once during a disastrous order and I exited out of the pop up everytime until they stopped. 

Grub hub to me is very alternative and an option when you don't want to deal with the other apps and aren't thinking about the technical stuff. There is more security in ubereats than Grub hub.

Most of the refund requests were for missing items, and all we expected was to get refunded for what was missing. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to get a refund when you didn‚Äôt get what you paid for.

I have friends who deliver for DoorDash, and they check the orders to make sure they‚Äôre correct. When I said 1 in 6 orders were wrong I was being generous, which means GH needs to honestly assess why they have so many problems. My wife and I can very much afford food delivery, and we‚Äôre not looking for free food. We just want GH to provide the services we pay for, and if something‚Äòs wrong with our order, we‚Äôd like reasonable compensation without being treated like criminals.

The way that GH‚Äôs customer service decided to ban us even though we have a long history of fully paid orders was an insult that I‚Äôm not going to forget. I wrote a sincere appeal and they doubled down on their BS. Now they expect us to come back to GH with a special offer for more bad service and abuse, but they‚Äôre totally missing the point. They need to pay dearly for treating customers who dare to call them out on bad orders like we‚Äôre the problem.

I have great respect for delivery drivers who care about their job and their customers. We‚Äôve been very generous to GH drivers, especially if there was a delay and they had to wait a long time for our food. We added cash tips to the already large tip they received in the app. I think this is what really upset us, because we‚Äòve been good customers who were very rudely kicked to the street.

As long as GH decides to punish customers who ask for legit refunds instead of fixing its business model, they‚Äôre going to keep losing customers. If you can‚Äôt properly and consistently perform the services you offer then you shouldn‚Äôt be in that business. We‚Äôre done with GH, and are giving our business to those who earn and appreciate it.

When we got so many bad GH orders on a consistent basis it made us feel like nobody actually cared about our orders, and that they were just going to take our money and give us the finger. It feels good to not have anxiety every time we place a food delivery order. It‚Äôs nice to know that the DoorDash drivers care enough to make sure we‚Äôre taken care of. This is what GH used to be, so if you drive for GH maybe you can help change this for the remaining GH customers.

I saw an article the other day that said DoorDash stock is performing well (up 18%), and my guess is that they‚Äôre taking full advantage of the GH banning policy and stepping up the quality of their service.

I‚Äòve been in restaurants watching delivery drivers while dining in and saw that some checked orders and some didn‚Äôt.

I‚Äôve done many types of jobs in my lifetime, and many of those (including the military) weren‚Äôt fun or high paying, but I still took pride in my work regardless if I was cleaning toilets or fixing machinery.

Your reply is exactly why GH doesn‚Äôt deserve to be in this business. Instead of saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre sorry that you‚Äôve had such poor experiences with our company‚Äú, you turn it back on the customer and say we‚Äôre hard to please. It‚Äôs somehow our fault that GH doesn‚Äôt call out vendors who can‚Äôt correctly fill orders. It‚Äôs our fault when we have a driver falsely claim our order was delivered just to find out from the replacement driver that the restaurant system was down and they couldn‚Äôt possibly have filled our order.

You‚Äôre being paid to provide a service, and customers are the ones who hire you. You‚Äôre a delivery professional, and your company should also be professional in the way they treat their customers. If you go to the Burger King drive thru and they short your order,do you just drive away and say keep the change? I doubt it.

My grievance with GH is that they are telling customers that it‚Äôs the customer‚Äôs loss if GH doesn‚Äôt deliver the correct orders. I understand that errors can be made, but 1 in 6 correct orders on average is setting the bar pretty low. We‚Äôve had multiple restaurants refuse to take GH orders and had us cancel GH and place the orders with someone else. They obviously don‚Äôt like the GH business model either.

DoorDash not making a profit? I got that 18% figure from the Wall Street Journal today, and I didn‚Äôt just pull that number out of the air. My guess is that they took your market share and won‚Äôt give it back by providing bad service. I‚Äôm confident that our DD orders will be mostly accurate, and when that doesn‚Äôt happen we‚Äôll stop using them.

We got by just fine before delivery services, and we don‚Äôt mind paying those who can do it right when we need them. We‚Äôre generally moving away from delivery services because we enjoy dining in and supporting the restaurants and their staff. We always tip very well because we enjoy seeing the smiles on the faces of those who appreciate it.

Yesterday I waited in line for 20 minutes at our favorite BBQ truck and had a very pleasant conversation with an elderly woman while I waited. This is a black-owned business, and I love helping their business grow and love seeing their very friendly smiles as they handle my order. Every time I give them a 15% tip even though I‚Äôm picking it up because I love what they do for our community.

So I had to explain to our own customer service rep that ALL McDonald's orders are in sealed bags, including the drinks. Which makes one doubt the competence of the average CSR. 

I will check sandwich bags from Subway and the like because I check for cookies and chips which may or may not have been put in the bag. I will not check some food orders because I would not necessarily know what I'm looking at (Indian and Asian orders, for example).

One of our favorite restaurants couldn‚Äôt get our orders right to save their lives, and I assume that GH can see that in their system.

The week before we got banned I was on vacation and we did more orders than usual, and it was one problem after another. I ordered chicken fried steak and they forgot the gravy, so how is this my fault?

My wife ordered a full steak and cheese hoagie and got nothing but meat and cheese, and they screwed up her friend‚Äôs order as well. How is this our fault?

We ordered from Taco Bell and the driver never delivered the food after claiming they did. The replacement driver then told us the system was down and verified the lie from the previous driver. We then ordered from another restaurant and they forgot the dessert. How is this our fault? This was two bad orders in an hour.

we ordered breakfast from the IHOP at the end of our street and we could see the driver at IHOP for nearly an hour, so we gave $10 extra cash tip for his time like we usually do. The whole order arrived stone cold. How is this our fault?

There we‚Äôre several more bad orders that week, and I remember doing a dance in the kitchen for the one they finally got right.   


Would either of you want to do business with GH after a week like that followed up with a permanent ban?

The drivers won‚Äôt claim any responsibility for order accuracy, and have no desire to help change current failed processes to improve the customer experience. GH could implement a better order audit process, but they apparently won‚Äôt enforce any measures against vendors who are regularly screwing GH customers.

GH customer service would much rather threaten to ban customers than to fix their broken business model. They don‚Äôt have a problem with jerking the chains of loyal customers who dare to inform them of bad orders, and then they turn around and beg for their business. A company who runs a delivery service without guarantees to compensate for unsatisfactory orders shouldn‚Äôt be in that business. You have one job; to deliver exactly what the customer ordered in a timely fashion. That is the shared responsibility of GH, the restaurants, and the drivers.   


The GH ban reminded us that we were fine before delivery services, and that our local restaurants need customers to dine in and support those businesses and their staff. Normally on a weekend from Friday to Sunday we would order food deliveries about four times on average. This weekend we‚Äôre ordering zero deliveries, and we‚Äôre either picking up our own food or dining in. We spent $45 at Red Lobster and left a $15 tip that was very much appreciated. That same order for delivery would have cost at least $80 and would have likely have been wrong. Yesterday I picked up our BBQ order and still gave a 15% tip, and that same delivery order would have cost us a hell of a lot more than what I paid.

It‚Äôs time to cut down on delivery services and give those profits to our local restaurants and their employees. We fell into a bad habit with delivery services, and now I‚Äôm happy that we‚Äôre going to use them more sparingly. The reason I get involved in these conversations is to help make people aware of bad service and bad business policies. I‚Äôve done many reviews on Yelp to help good businesses thrive and to warn consumers about bad ones.   


I believe that my assessments of GrubHub are accurate. Management doesn‚Äôt seem to  have control over the business as a whole, and they appear to have little or no QC measures in place to handle bad vendors. There‚Äôs absolutely no excuse for the tremendous amount of bad orders we received, before the ban, and I don‚Äôt see any indications that this will change any time soon.   


Right now the DoorDash in our area seems to be the most reliable, but we‚Äôre going to generally cut way down on food deliveries.

They really, really don't want to deactivate customers. In fact some apps (GH too?) will require a pin code so that the customer has to acknowledge delivery before the driver can mark it completed. 

Drivers are a lot easier to replace, plus they have a ton more data about us than they do the customer. 

None of this fits the OP's scenario, though. It seems like either some glitch in the app or in the driver's thought process resulted in the customer getting a serious flag (like a safety issue).

Why not? They keep that tip anyway. On the rare occasion these companies will do anything about it, they can still get orders from different platforms. So they're actually being incentivized to care less and do less than the already minimal amount of effort the job takes. Companies only really need to fire the absolute worst cases and still greatly benefit from a market saturated with drivers.

Service workers are asking for more tips because of inflation, customers are getting worse service because of inflation, but companies are posting record profits while workers and customers stew in mutual animosity.

Want to ensure my order gets accepted.,"Depends on how expensive the area you live in is.  I don't deliver Grubhub, but I do deliver Doordash and Ubereats.  Both of those services hide large tips which Grubhub doesn't do.  So the math is a little different.  But during slow times of day I will take rural runs for $2 a mile ($1 a mile round trip) because that covers my costs and I know I am not losing money but I am gambling that there is a hidden tip.  During busier times of day (lunch or dinner time) I won't take the rural runs for less than $3 a mile ($1.50 per mile round trip), but again I am gambling on a hidden tip.  About half the time I end up seeing an extra $20 or so that was not displayed so I come out ahead.  Since GrubHub doesn't hide tips, I would probably need more like $4 a mile during slow times and $5 a mile during busy times.  But that's just me in my market.  I live in a busy suburban market that is surrounded by lots of rural homes that are owned by well paid commuters.  My pay usually ends up between $25 and $30 an hour, but that is before car expenses, taxes, health insurance on the open market, etc.  Honestly I'm barely making more than a McDonald's worker after taking into account the things that I pay for that they don't.

The resturant was too close to closing when you ordered apparently. They might not have even realized you ordered if you ordered post closing. 

GH should have cut off even being able to order at all before that point from them so really it was their fault likely. Usually they cut off delivery at least 30 mins before they close but sometimes there's a glitch and it doesn't. 

I can't order often, budget, but I actually prefer local delivery from the restaurants because the delivery fee tends to be way lower and they are way faster than the GH drivers.

Always check the restaurant hours before ordering. If you are within a half hour of closing don't order even if you can because no restaurant is going to do a last minute order like that.

As someone who used to drive for them, they'll stack orders on you or add orders while you're on another order and for some reason push the current order down the list.

On top of that since grubhub chooses the order for us if we don't follow it we can receive strikes on our account and eventually be de activated.

I've had people's orders sit in my car while I make 2 other deliveries even though I picked theirs up first. It sucks but we really don't have a choice but to follow grubhub.",/r/grubhub/comments/zonvu6/driver_took_order_while_making_distant_deliveries/j0o4lqc/

When the order comes in it will tell you the dollars and the total distance.  If you assume that the milage to base is about 60 cents, then everything after is either tip of ""bonus"".  Let's give an example:

Offer 1:  McFatty's, 6 Miles for $3

Offer 2: McFatty's, 6 Miles for $4

Offer 3: McFatty's, 6 Miles for $8

Offer 4: McFatty's, 6 Miles for $12

Let's break down what we see in the offers:

1 didn't tip, so thats a minimum pay.

2 tipped 2 or 3 dollars (low tip), or the order has been sitting for 15 minutes (2 to 3 dollars in bonus).

3 tipped 2 or 3 dollars and the order sat for 30 minutes ($5 dollar bonus), or tipped 4 to 5 dollars

4 left an 4 to 5 dollar tip and the order sat, or left a solid tip.

#You can generally guess the tip once you accept the order and count the items.

Multiple resteraunt or address Offers are the main problem now.  In order to avoid adding the bonus, a no tip or low tip order is added to a decent tip order.*

Call GrubHub and have the whole order refunded.  The resteraunt still gets paid, the driver still gets paid, and grubhub eats the cost of their greed.

By all means, if the they take a non-road construction based detour, adjust the tip.

I had a driver which it wasn't his fault I'm sure bring me a half asseed completely different order than what I ordered. It was the restaurant fault cause they have been messing up my orders a lot and ruining them. I put in a complaint and went straight to the help / customer service section and reported my entire order being wrong. They instructed me to take photos of the food. I did it.

They instantly refunded me the entire cost of the original order and gave me 22.45 in uber cash cause I used a promo code to get 15 bucks off my order which was rather large so they compensated me for the lost value of the coupon code as well. I was shocked and very happy but still angry with the KFC for what they did. 

You can also talk to customer service aka a live person. I had a HORRIBLE experience once waiting for my order for over 2 hours cause this idiot couldn't find my home but didn't want to be honest and fucking admit he drove into an area he doesn't know trying to pick up any order he could. They offered me all types of options and I just took my refund. 

Ubereats will come through for you especially if you're a loyal, well spending, consistent customer who doesn't abuse the refund system. I try not to do it a lot and when I do something is actually geniunely missing usually 1 thing. Once in a while I will report a small add on as missing if they try to fuck with me just to get some of that cash back.

Uber is more responsible with handling problems 85-90% of the time than other apps and I've heard horror stories about door dashers being cunts and asswipe acting & behaving like they run the service with: manipulating your orders, eating your food blatantly, skipping picking up your order if they don't like the tip amount even if it's reasonable for the distance and area, letting your food sit on purpose and not delivering correctly. I've had issues with ubereats drivers in the city and downtown areas but usually with tricky areas to be delivered too.

The exact thing just happened to me yesterday, no card on file with GrubHub just PayPal and I have NO idea how the thieves got through. They ordered wings and then burritos almost 100$ halfway across America. No orders got cancelled even though I was frantically ""chatting"" with a GrubHub person on the app about 3 minutes after ""my order"" was placed saying THIS IS FRAUD, I DID NOT PLACE THIS ORDER, PLEASE STOP THIS, FLAG MY ACCOUNT I DONT CARE. They responded ""we're sorry for the inconvenience"" like 4 times before I closed out of the app and tried to call PayPal... made sure to change my password, unlink GrubHub from my account 100%... anyway, played phone tag, got nowhere, gotta call again tomorrow and call the credit card company.

Whenever I try to make any PayPal transaction they always ask for my fingerprint or they send me a code in a text message. I am confused about how this was able to occur because of that. No automatic payments authorized at all anywhere.

I want to know more about this and if anyone has been able to get their money back or have any luck having a conversation w GrubHub (although I doubt it) I am interested to hear about your stories... about to go @ GrubHub on Twitter with some strong words tbh. 

I am just weirded out because PayPal literally NEVER lets me make a transaction without some sort of verification except like once or twice when its been on my reconized device but their device wouldnt have been reconized as my device because its rando online thieves so ??? 

Also, in case anyone was going to suggest this, my password for my GrubHub account and the PayPal account connected to it were very different passwords when this happened so it wasnt just like oops they got my password and coincidentally it was the same for everything. Nope.

AND, I did have an Amazon Prime free trial thing that I cancelled a couple months ago but I didnt think it was connected to my GrubHub at all its possible though??? Since others mentioned Amazon Prime as a possible piece of this puzzle

I tried settling it with their customer service but after an hour the first woman stopped talking suddenly and then 15 more minutes went past and she ended the chat (it's not cuz I didn't respond, because I had a question/followed up on her troubleshoot)troubleshooting. First she had me uninstall and reinstall the app, change my password, and maybe one other thing and it kept saying not linking...

So I immediately tried again since she closed the chat and got a guy that basically didn't even try helping. He said i should figure it out because if he has rk verify the email attached to both is tbe same then he would need to call themans it coupd take a while (he never did, btw). So the only other thing he did was to just  ask why i was asking GH and not Amazon (insinuating it's an Amazon problem, not a GH problem... even thoigh I log in tk prime just fine - but I can't activate nor log in on the GH app). 

AHYWAY point if my post. It works fine on your computer. If you type amazon.com/grubhub and I believe you just have to click  activate again and ot automatically brings you ti a GH web version. 
It's just annoying AF that it's theres so many hoops to jump through, it can only be accessed via computer, and the customer service to help with this type of problem just ignores it when they've tried several things or, pawns off tbe responsibility.

Did you guys know they CHARGE you if you try to change your tip you gave the driver after its done? Especially if it's a lower amount? They don't tell you about the penalty.

I left a good tip for the driver to pick up my pizza and food from a pizza shop a little further from my home but near my area. They give you a window time but absolutely NO DRIVER NAME, NO DRIVER PICTURE, NO CAR MAKE OR LICENSE PLATE, no rating on them like Ubereats. Nothing. You don't know who your driver is, where they are or if they are doing multiple orders or side hustling another order from yours. I had no way of anticipating when he'd show up so he came randomly a little later than window time. I didn't have 1 item in the set I ordered that. I was willing to let it go but he was allover the place with it. It was poor service. I reported the whole main pizza missing from it so I could get my refund cause I was pissed with the ancient long wait.

They refunded me. No problems. I made a stupid mistake by trying to change the tip cause I felt his service was the worse. Guess what? Grub hub fucking goes behind my back and gives me a $9.56 charge for tip adjustment and other fees. So along with the little side I got I ended up paying a $16.00 tip.

Fucking $16.00 tip for a trip in distance not worth that at all. No way. Not even in downtown in my state would any tip amount to 16 unless you feel that generous. That's a regular Uber trip tip amount. I was pissed. But that was on me cause if I had left it alone it wouldn't have happened. If any of you use grub hub and the driver messes your food up, arrives late, screws you over etc, just report half your order as missing or wrong or the whole major portion and get your refund like me. Don't do anything else & uninstall. Grub Hub drivers irk me anyways although I had a nice man deliver my food once but he nearly left my house driving down the road elsewhere.

Grubhub is second rate and messy. Never again.
I only ordered with them again cause my amex gives me a $10 monthly dining credit for grubhub among other random restaurants (that are not in my area but 1 that is in the city, shake shack) and cause Amazon Prime members were offered Grub Hub+ service free for 1 year. I signed up for it long ago and decided to put it to use. Never ever use Grub during bad weather either. Just don't.

No disrespect to the other person replying to you but I hate when drivers for these apps try to jump into the convo and negate what people are saying. I understand they have the experience we don't with these apps but it doesn't make it less valid or wrong.

Uber eats has priority option where for an extra fee between $1.99-3.99 (depending how far the food place is) the driver delivers directly to you. So if you pick this option, the driver has to pick up your food then go to your house / where you are, NOT going elsewhere to sit and wait for more orders or pick up your food then deliver 5 other meals then get to you.

Grubhub doesn't offer this option so everyone is at the mercy of the Driver cause he could be driving to multiple restaurants after getting your food on purpose or delivering everyone else food and leaving yours a 3rd or last option. That's why I don't like Grub hub. Very ghetto system and not trustworthy at all. This only happens on Uber eats if you chose standard.

If there is, and you paid it and this still happened, GH owes you an explanation and a refund. 

If the driver is using multiple apps at the same time, that's a different issue.  Have GH support look into it.  If he was only delivering for GH at the time, they'll be able to see why he was everywhere he was during that time period.  If he was multi-apping, they will see he went places that don't make sense for the order(s) he was on for GH and will deactivate him for violation of TOS.

Edit:  Also, the drivers won't see any info about it being a ""high priority"" order nor do we receive any of those extra fees you pay that may imply or flat out promise you prioritized service.

I noticed the more-complete story here; sounds to me like that‚Äôs not so much GrubHub‚Äôs fault.

That latter option is probably what your driver was doing, as I don‚Äôt remember ever seeing more than 2 GrubHub orders stacked together at a time. 

Incidentally, I operate somewhere between those two extremes- I take multiple orders but only ones that go in the same direction, so I can drive a relatively straight line and deliver everything in a timely fashion. I also have a hierarchy of order importance- DoorDash and GrubHub take priority over UE for timeliness, and usually GH is #1 as the value of orders on there are higher than DD.

I got a membership through prime. Prime teamed up with them to offer GH+ for 1 year free. When it's time for it to end I'll cancel it a month before. Its not the best at all, I don't like how they try to suggest the tip for you and auto put in the tip then put in what amount they want. Uber doesn't do that. I accidentally reported my 2 liter soda as missing (the driver put my food on the door knob and I couldn't see the full bag so I just auto assumed I didn't get it cause any other driver in my area sets the soda on the step) either way, I got my full refund for it including tax.

I ordered today to take advantage of the $7 credit they offered (Uber has way better deals i.e $15 off orders if at least 20-30 bucks, 40% off, etc). So my no delivery fee, my 7 credit and using 10.17 from my Amex points came through for me and my order is legit 21 something including the refund. Also my Amex offers a dinning credit so I'm hoping they apply the $10 credit so my order will be around 11.

Otherwise I don't deal with GH unless I really have a taste for something and uber doesn't have a deal going on. I haven't used doordash yet.

It usually doesn't line up with reality. Shortly before I got banned (for refusal to wait 30 minutes for food without getting paid for it.) I forgot to mark arrived at a restaurant. I picked up the food, navigated to the customer, and the order was removed from my task list halfway to the customer. Called support and they put in a complaint for me because they could clearly see I was on the way to the customer, but ultimately, GrubHub was the only malicious party. Took the customer's money, took my pay, and failed to check to see if the driver had the food before reassignment.

Did I steal the food? Well, if the order wasn't reassigned by GrubHub, then yes. If there was a way for me to be reimbursed for GrubHub's error, then yes.

idk about others but to me.. saying ""no ones stealling"" or ""will never"" . and saying stuff like ""always steal"" . are both just as silly as the other.. one of you even said it. people have issues we're all human and different. hope for the best but know that anythings possible really.",/r/grubhub/comments/w7u6f4/tired_of_my_food_being_stolen/ikcpysz/

I also know that the platform apparently sends texts to the customers on our behalf because I once had a customer text me asking why the order would be so late due to a text they received from me that I had never sent. I believe the system automatically generates and sends texts to customers on behalf of the driver with updates about the order.

But most people won't tip enough to make it worthwhile. Generally most drivers want at least $2/mile for an order to be cost effective. Remember, the driver has to drive to the restaurant from wherever they are (probably 1-2 miles on average, but could be more or less), deliver the order to you (12 miles), then drive back to their starting area (10-14 miles roughly). So for your hypothetical 12 mile delivery, the driver could *easily* have to do 24 miles, and more is entirely possible. So when we say we won't drive for under $2 mile on a 12 mile order, what we are actually demanding boils down to around $1/mile.

To be clear, I am talking total order pay, not your tip. GH does pay us something, but not enough to justify a long drive like that. 

Essentially, I recommend tipping $1/mile for your delivery minimum. I would also add a couple bucks if there are other things complicating your delivery (you know the restaurant has terrible parking, you are in an apartment complex from hell, your order has 27 drinks in cups, etc.). If you do that, we will get your order to you as quickly as possible. And regardless of anything else, I recommend a $3 minimum tip.



> I just don't want to order and have my funds taken up if no one is ever going to take it as a job, if that makes sense.

That won't happen, if your order isn't delivered, you will get  a refund. But on a 12 mile delivery, there is a chance your food will be cold, even with the best intentioned driver. Ordering from a closer restaurant is always safer.

And FWIW, all these comments apply equally to Uber Eats or Doordash. None of them pay us a living wage.",/r/grubhub/comments/10addmo/grubhub_app_showing_restaurants_that_are_like_12/j45bflw/

I woulddnt want someone to end up driving for an hour just for me, and i cant afford a fifty dollar top on some fried rice, lol.   

Regarding the funds thing, what I don't want to have happen is like on doordash, if no one ever picks up your order, and you end up having to cancel it, you don't get that refund until 2 to 3 days pretending on your bank, or they would try to get you to take it in credits on the app.  It sucks that the base rate isn't higher.

Just to be clear, I'm not saying you should tip for $1 every mile the driver has to drive, just the one way distance from the restaurant to your house. So in this case, I would tip $12 minimum, maybe a bit more depending on other factors.

But yeah, ordering closer is better, both because a lot more drivers will accept it, and because your food will arrive sooner. But if you are *really* craving fried rice from that restaurant, $12 is not *that* bad.

>  It sucks that the base rate isn't higher. I mean i wouldn't want to make someone drive that far for me anyway, but i will say delivery has been a life changer for me since becoming disabled, which is why I tip well when i can use the services. I'll stick to places nearer me though.

Yeah, the base pay used to be a lot higher, and the level of service was higher by all accounts. It's basically impossible to make a living on these apps anymore.

It was removed with penalty instead of driver care removing it without penalty and paying out a small fee for going to the restaurant. In those instances you see in the green box the pay you received for a cancelled order.

When orders exceed 30min wait I call the customer and ask if they want to cancel it or keep the order. If they don't I cancel it with driver care. (Some drivers will cancel an order to get their $2 or less for much less wait times)

If the customer does want to wait for the order I decide for myself if it's worth the wait and if it is not I reject it and receive the same ""removed with penalty""

I deliver as well as utilize the services myself and I've just adheres to all of those (before I started delivering) because frankly it's just plain common sense. I work as a server so I know what kind of service one gets when they return to a restaurant especially after tipping well so if I don't have the money to tip a delivery driver I don't order delivery because it is a want and not a need. I do see how they pair crappy tippers orders with exceptional tippers orders and force the crappy tippers order to go out first(most likely because none would pick it up as a single order so it has to be piggybacked) and the great tippers gets pushed back because of cheap customers. Tonight everyone tipped and GrubHub was paying me for the 6 delivering deliveries 27$ and some change and I went home with 96$ and see me change. If it weren't for tips Boone would do this as a side gig or full-time ever. 28$ for three hours from GrubHub are you kidding me? I just happened to find a corner of Philadelphia, PA that has the right kinda tipping customers that overcompensate for a few of the lowballera I get stick with.  Anyways I like your post and I hope more customers see it because tipping is the key. It ensures that your order is going to be brought to you and taken care of the entire time from restaurant to my car to your house. If the service happens to be horrendous and NOT the fault of the driver the tip can be lowered upon completion of delivery, but I don't see anyone screwing up any order that the tip is exceptionally high or even right on par for that matter.

Most of the time if the order is wrong, or late, or whatever, it isn't the driver's fault. The driver would just have busted their hump, going as quick as they can, and done everything they were told, and then, due to some other factor making the order late, or wrong, or whatever, have their tip disappear. And when you work 100% for tips, that is the same as having your boss subtract pay from your account after you've left work for the day because, while the job was done, the boss thinks it could have been done better, so you get money you were given under an agreed upon contract removed. 

If you'd like to do it anyway, Uber Eats promotes this kind of thing, and you can take the tip back after every completed order if you like.

The only time it would make sense to do this would be if the driver overtly, and undeniably did something deliberately unethical. Beyond that, there's not much drivers have control over enough to make your service bad in a way that is their fault.

Nonetheless, a lot of customers on Uber Eats do this all the time. They put a huge tip on the order, knowing it will mean better service, and then take it off the second the order is complete.

So, we have to consider that. This means that there's no way to tell, without some expertise about how GH corporate works, to say exactly what drivers get, vs what the customer spends in fees, but we do know the vast majority of the mark ups go to GH. Only tips go to the driver for sure. Second, when a driver sees, for example, a 4 dollar order, most automatically reject it. It then spins around, with GH adding more money, very slowly, until it is accepted. During this time your order is sitting on a shelf, getting cold. They aren't usually accepted until they're over 8 dollars, minimum, and the order pays at least 2 dollars per mile between the restaurant and the customer's house. If you want your order to be taken as quickly as possible, make sure you tip at least 2 dollars for every mile between your house and the restaurant, and the tip is at least 8 dollars.

I'm sorry to hear that. However, this is far out of the norm. Either the restaurants really are all that bad in your area, or the drivers are, either way, that's bizarre. 

That said, leaving your market aside, in a normal market, where drivers are not stealing the food, and so, it is the restaurant's fault, we don't know how many items are in an order frequently for a few reasons. Here are three of them:

1.) The app will say the number of items, but the list of dishes is much, much higher, and packaging is unique to each restaurant. For example: The app may say, ""2 items,"" and inside the order is a list of fifteen things, none of which we're familiar with, and all of these things are packaged together in varying sizes and shapes of a few containers. I don't know the difference between mizudako, and the nori and mirin that come with it, nor how many containers each requires. Does Mizudako and Nori come in the same container, along with the mirin? Or three containers? Then, add another 10 items to the list, and the fact that there are only 6 containers, and the issue is compounded even further. Even if I opened up all the containers, and counted each item, it wouldn't help, because I don't know what any of them look like, nor how many of each item there are, nor which are sides, vs the main dish, and so on. 

If I tried to count an order, I may come up with 60 items, when the order says 15, or 5 items, when the order says 15. This is because every restaurant is different. There may be 60 pieces of food and sauces and sides for an order that says ""15 items,"" because the restaurant considers things that are technically multiple pieces of food to be 1 item. Or there may be only 5 pieces for the same order, because the restaurant counts individual dishes with multiple pieces as multiple items. For example, Taco Bell orders will say ""30 items,"" when there's only one, small bag, containing a few items with silly Taco Bell names, because taco bell counts every sauce packet, and other small items. Whereas a pizza place will say ""1 item"" even though there's a pizza with a lot of extras inside the box, including sauces, peppers, and such. Add to that, the fact that I've no idea what a mega loco burrito crunch with south of the border twisties looks like, nor how to tell it apart from an extra guaco crave wrap with Bell blasters, nor how many items each one of these ridiculous sounding things even are, and you can imagine the impossibility of figuring out if your order is all there or not. And, obviously, you can tell I literally never eat at Taco Bell, but their constantly changing menu, and silly food names are prime examples of conclusively confounding items.

2.) Sometimes the bags are tied in a knot, or have a sticker holding them shut. We are instructed not to open them in these instances.

3.) Our hands are not clean. We are not in a kitchen with a sink at hand. We are out, driving around, touching door handles, counter tops, and a lot of other germy surfaces. You do not want us thumbing through your food in the first place to see if your burger has ketchup and tomato, but no minced onion, or picking through the mess of food inside a styrofoam container to see if there's baked beans hidden under the ribs and mac and cheese.",/r/grubhub/comments/vzvv76/some_tips_on_ordering_from_grubhub_if_you_want_to/j02mn2q/

Thank you for taking the time to create an answer that described the question that I was asking. I kind of guessed that the up charges and service fees were going to GH, but I guess my real thought was how much is fair to the driver. 

I‚Äôm sure that each situation is unique, based on what you outlined. So, for instance, the order that I placed 3x last week to arrive asap to my business is $18.31 after everything GH adds. The restaurant is 2.9 miles away. I should tip at least $6 to make sure my food comes, and I‚Äôve been meeting the driver in the lobby and stating my name when I see them come in the door. 

I like GH even though they mark up a lot. To be completely honest, I‚Äôve ordered 8-10 times and left the tip at $1 not even thinking and it‚Äôs been cancelled twice, and I got my food within 45 minutes (how long I was expecting) the other times. I will make those changes today and try to tip at least $2/mi. I don‚Äôt really feel like paying twice the cost, but I don‚Äôt want to be unfair to the drivers, and it is very convenient. As long as the drivers get the extra amount that I specify for tip, I will begin doing that. 

Thank you for your time and for outlining this so that everyday GH orderers can get an idea on the best way to do things for themselves and also the drivers that bring their food.",/r/grubhub/comments/vzvv76/some_tips_on_ordering_from_grubhub_if_you_want_to/iij69fa/

Think about hourly wage that the driver would be making at a regular job. Drivers are going to only do it if there pay comes out to a reasonable hourly wage and pass on shitty tipping orders all the time, or take them and then fuck around and do other shit first because who cares about the guy's order with .50 cent tip 4 miles away when theres gas to get and other orders that get basically flown to because they arent cheap retards. May even just forget about it all together and let you sit and wait thinking you're getting it (happens all the time instead of passing the order, not always on purpose but I think otgers it is). A mile isnt a minute in a lot of places, like most major cities especially during busy times which is when the majority of business for drivers is. If it's 20 miles yeah $40 is a huge tip, the higher you go with mileage the less that pans out. At the same time look at that on a map and think about how long that drive will take in a city with probable traffic and consider they will have to drive back to the regoon they were working in for more orders. I wouldnt, but if it's 3 miles 6 dollars is totally reasonable and often people tip a bit more than that and they get their shit fast and good service all around usually.  
Go ahead and tip low if you want to be a cheap asshole and watch your order be cold, fries be missing, date realize she's with a cheap turd, or passed along by so many people that you just don't get a driver.

It announces it to drivers on certain screens. It says ""Tips are available 1 hour after delivery since customers can change the amount until then.""

Again, seriously, this cannot be strictly legal. In no other job can your pay be removed AFTER you do the job and have been paid what you contractually agreed upon, without court action. Your boss, or customers, cannot, for example, subtract pay from your check while you work at Mcdonald's, or Home Depot, because they think you did a bad job. They'd have to take you to court, and would probably lose. Generally, in every other job, the only option for bad employees is to fire them.

If enough drivers could afford good lawyers, and sue, this would be gone. Unfortunately Uber counts on drivers being broke, which is the only reason to work for them, so this will never happen. All we can do is hope DD and GH don't add this feature, too.

Then people who need delivery have no option.

What I and other drivers are promoting is giving drivers enough money to allow them to pay their bills and keep driving. We do not get hourly. Tips are everything. It is irrelevant whether or not it is an easy job or not. Driving costs money, so does having a cell phone required for the job, insurance, gas, maintenance, etc. Hence, easy or not, this job costs drivers money that must be counterbalanced by a reasonable gain, or else it becomes impossible to do the job.

It would be nice if people who really need food delivered didn't have to tip, but that's capitalism. People that truly cannot go get food should look into government programs for the disabled. Or maybe Grubhub could give them free delivery, and tip the driver themselves. However expecting the drivers to do charity work is not only absurd, it's impossible, as it would cause drivers to eventually not be able to afford to do the job at all.

I'm a delivery driver and I recently accepted an order from someone who was a college student but hardly knew how to speak English. I found this out when the ice cream machine at the restaurant he ordered from was down, and I had to call him to ask what he wanted to do about it. We talked (well, attempted to) for a good 5 to 10 minutes, just for him to hang up on me, and then message, ""what did the say?"" I was honestly really upset, because I had already been sitting there around 10 minutes going back and forth with him trying to figure out what he was saying because I couldn't understand him, just to be back at square one. I said, ""McDonald's ice cream machine is down. I need to know if you would like a refund for that item, or if you'd like to replace it with a smoothie, slushie, or frappe?"" He replied, ""replace it."" I said, ""with what?"" He said, ""smoothie."" I said, ""okay would you like strawberry banana, or mango pinapple?"" AND HE FREAKING SAID, ""vanilla shake."" I said, ""NO ICE CREAM THE MACHINE IS DOWN."" He finally said strawberry smoothie. And I was like okay got it! It only gets worse. I told him I'm in soinso parking lot and he asked me to go to the other one. I said I'd try to find it. So I drove around trying to look for it just for this one to be RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE ONE I WAS IN!!!!! I told him he'd have to come out and get it, that I couldnt leave it as his door because I don't have access to college dorms. He seemed upset but I don't make those rules the college does. Finally, I git his order to him just to get paid $6. Don't get me wrong im thankful for the money but hot damn all of that wasn't worth the trouble. Customers like you are a blessing to me.

I know most drivers hate this what Im about to say, but its better to tip cash in person, as long as you dont make the driver wait a long time for it. I say this because they calculate the delivery charge, and pay more when customers either dont tip, or tip low. So when the driver gets to your location they can earn more if its a cash tip forcing the company to pay more on the delivery out of pocket...

On the other hand it is 100% possible that the direction took them to the wrong house. That has happened to me a few times due to the house and mailbox not having a number on them or/and the directions pinning the wrong house. It happens, but certainly not on purpose. That said (in my area at least) their have been reports of drivers (especially of doordash) accepting an order to get the name, then when they have picked the order up, instead of entering on the app that it has been picked up, they will cancel it and keep the food. In other cases the order won't get sent to the store (especially on Uber eats) and ive known of some drivers to say they've picked up the food even if they haven't, just to get to money out of wasting their time. It's frustrating for us delivery drivers when something goes wrong, such as a restaurant being out of an item and being unable to contact the customer, or the direcions taking you in the middle of nowhere, or going on an entire shopping spree at dg or ordering over $100 worth of food just for your delivery driver card to decline. Many things can go wrong, but I speak from my experience when I say it has saved my ass from going broke and loosing everything. I'm a 21 yr old single mom, and I'm so so very thankful for anyone who uses the delivery apps and tips well. Keep in mind that although we do get paid from the delivery app, it isn't very much when you order from a location 10 miles away from your house. Doordash only pays $2 no matter how far the delivery is going on a normal day. The most I've seen doordash pay their drivers is $5 per delivery and again, that's even if the order is going 10 miles.

Orders can be passed around for a long time. I've seen up to 4 hours. Usually if no one accepts the order GrubHub will add money to the order in hopes someone will accept it.
The food itself is up to the restaurant. Most fast food places don't make the order until the driver arrives, or it shows it has been accepted.
If the customer cancels then the restaurant keeps the food if already made, if not it just doesn't get made. They all have tablets that show the order, who accepted it, what time the driver is supposed to be there to pick it up, and if it's cancelled.

They are 1099 contracted self employed delivery drivers to pick up the order, and drop it off.. They don't prepare your food or package it... The business is responsible for packaging, and food prep.... Orders can be passed around in queue for awhile depends on the situation, and its variable as to why a driver will pass on it or accept it. Can be location area mileage pay or any other personal reason why, like for example I don't want to drive 13 miles on my last order late at night before I go home after driving all day for 200 miles so ill pass on a long one.  Food can sometimes sit around, if drivers cancel orders for some reason, and the order was put into the system, and the order gets resubmitted en loop until someone except it.. For example pizza order driver accepts get to restaurant, employee says oh we just got that order or we just put it in the oven its going to be a 40 min wait. Driver says yea I'm not waiting 40 mins for $2 tip, cancels order. Sometimes Ive heard from employees or managers that multiple drivers cancelled, but by the time I got there the order is ready so I take it..  The other day I went to pick up an order at a mom, and pop restaurant, and the lady was on the phone talking to her friend laughing while watching tv, while her daughter worked the counter, and did not know how to operate the tablet. Her mom gets off the phone comes and looks, and says oh it just came in right now, it'll be an hour wait because lamb takes awhile to cook. I'm like yea that orders been sitting there for awhile...  ok bye.... 

Just because someone is a felon does not mean they're a degenerate who would do something to your food. Even a person with a clean background could be a degenerate. Even the business you are ordering through, the owner could be a felon with a background who opened their own business, or bought into a franchise... When it comes to Felons its a slippery slope because different States have different laws, and how far back they can go. Its more of a business to business relationship when drivers are contracted because they are 1099 self employed contractors.. I get your concern tho.. Look at the bright side if they have a background, and they're doing something positive for earning money its better than them doing something stupid like robbing someone or selling dope to your kids than working for it because someone judges them, life goes on for them after they served their time they have to live life like you or anyone else, and pay bills, or support their kids.. Every day you get into your car someone anyone even a felon could get into an accident with you but yet you leave your house, and drive daily lol... I think your over thinking it on a simple delivery...

They charge so many fees up your arse that you pay 2x the list price, and that's op top of the list price being 20-30% above the restaurant if you order directly.

I had the 1 month trial. My favorite Poke place charges $14 for their large bowl. On GrubHub, it was 18. Then they charged a $7 service fee, $2 tax. Was then $27... before tip... at least they voided the $2.99 delivery fee. Paid double what I would've if I had driven 15 minutes to pick it up. 

Food delivery apps are a scam. It's like paying for Hulu Ad-Supported in 2022 when almost every mobile provider offers it as a free ad-don. They also allow drivers to abuse the system by using multiple phones, and punish those who don't accept shitty orders where people don't tip.

Many drivers like 99.9% of them double app to avoid gaps in the time they work and to earn the most they think they can make. So that could be the issue 

Or 

It‚Äôs the restaurants fault. Grubhub is just an app it‚Äôs the middle man between you and the restaurant. When you place your order it sends a confirmation to a tablet provided by grubhub in the restaurant. They need to accept this notification or at least see it for your order to be made. There are many restaurants that mess this up. Where they don‚Äôt print a ticket, they forget about it or just plainly don‚Äôt care. Which is weird considering they get charged a fee, but in this world being dumb could be popular. 

So there is really no way to know. Your tip is so meaningless because even me if I see a massive order it doesn‚Äôt really matter. 

Give you an example if your order shows up at 30$ for 3 miles. I would accept it just like I would accept a 12$ order at 3 miles. I have a better chance at making more money accepting the 12$ then the 30$ order and making more money overall. Why? Because the big orders usually have the most mistakes meaning the restaurant is delayed. They make a mistake. The 12$ order is basic quickly made and I finish the delivery in 10-15min. At the end of the hour I make 40$ and hour 10$ more than the one that would take me one hour",/r/grubhub/comments/vs0fhs/late_delivery_because_driver_is_making_multiple/ilw9f4w/

Last night I had a jackass run thru a redlight at 65 mph and could have hit me. I've already been in one accident six month ago. Your paying for delivery service plus the company has to pay it's employees and earn a small profit. Guess what...I've had many orders on doordash where the customer ordered $50 worth of food only to pay for $5.50 delivery fee. My expenses were at least $1.5 so I gross netted $4 in a half hour. That's $8 an hour for my time before I include vehicle expenses. People like you are part of $3 delivery crowd that I decline all the time.

If anything we are business owners doing business we contract with. Some value the service and some don't. Don't worry your part of the 60% I regularly decline because you are looking for free food delivery. Delivery and expensive food prices are mutually exclusive and not part of a bundle deal. That means that if some entitled jackass buys $50 worth of food the restaurant is not miraculously subsidizing that delivery. Like I said in that $19 cost maybe $11 is the cost of delivery plus what ever the delivery service charges. So if I get paid $9 for delivery out of that $19 (and it's really $17 because you would have to pay taxes on that food anyway of $2.50) I maybe net $6. The problem is two fold...These apps are pandering to jokesters like you that feel entitled to Amazon delivery prices of $1.5 per item and the time cost to deliver these items is anywhere between 20-30 minutes per delivery. best case scenario is 20 minutes as we no longer regularly get dual pick-ups from single restaurants unless the apps are desperate.,/r/grubhub/comments/vqqa7v/the_price_jump_just_got_ridiculous/if3c13b/

NOW, PHYSICALLY pick up your second orderBUT choose the ""order is not ready"" option on the menu. Grab both orders and start your 1st delivery. By the time you get to that, you can choose the ""got order"" button for your second order. Youre covered because you pushed out the eta so you dont get those nasty ""youve picked up an order but not moving"" messages that flag your account as late.

These are usually pay orders where we use a grubhub card to pay at the restaurant (I refuse to use this) or the restaurants turn us away at the door. Grubhub can post their own price in these cases which is higher than the restaurants to make more money or the restaurants increase their price on grubhub (which ironically gets them removed) to compensate for the 25% cut towards grubhub (and other apps). The best way to get your food delivered is if the restaurant delivers themselves (rare now).

From my experience most orders, but not always that have a high tip, are not made on time, and the driver has to wait for them up to 10 - 40 mins... Just really depends on what is being ordered, and how busy the place is... Since we dont get paid hourly, and are not employees I try not to wait more than 10 mins because I calculate the ride time, and mileage, and gas. As a Driver my goal is to do as many deliveries per hour as possible, and my calculations are based on the laws of averages... I can get stuck doing one order I have to wait 30 mins before its ready, then drive 30 mins to the customer for $15 hr.. Or I can pass this order to someone else, and do 3 food already done orders with 15 min delivery time in one hour for $10 each. Im always going to go with the $30 hr.... Why work for less when you can get more... Just depends on how someone views something. I would say $18 is appropriate tho for your situation its actually above average than most.. It would go a longer way if you gave tip in cash to be honest because it forces the company to compensate the driver out their pocket for the delivery, but most drivers wont accept that kinda order. One time I had a $1 tip, and when I dropped off the order the lady came out, and gave me $15 cash.

They went from focusing exclusively on delivery to focusing on dine in and to go while at the same time dealing with supply and staffing shortages. Most of them deprioritize delivery versus the other two and do not put much focus into it. Instead of one or two staff members focused on delivery you often have the order going through a lot more less focused hands. 

Drivers can have an impact on missing items by checking orders, checking what is handed to them, and asking questions but they often have limited access (sealed bags, lack of menu knowledge) and employees often just say it is there even when it isn't.",/r/grubhub/comments/v2gz00/missing_items/iasr78g/

The last few times I have ordered delivery myself I have also had horrible experiences. The last time I got ubereats I ordered a cinnamon roll that was literally half eaten. The whole order I threw in the garbage and got a refund. I have had a driver from grubhub that did not speak English and refused to try to find my condo and just sat in the parking lot. I was watching 4 young kids so I had to leave them inside while I had to search for HIM in the parking lot. Lazy ass. These experiences have discouraged me from being a delivery customer.

My suggestion in your instance is this: make sure to call the restaurant and ask for the bag to be stapled or sealed with stickers or tape. This might be an unpopular opinion but you can also ask grubhub to reduce or take away the tip which is what I did in the instances above.

Their business model is to extract money from the pre-existing restaurant market by going around minimum wage.  If there was a way to get food delivered to people's doors for less than the price of the food plus a taxi without breaking labor laws McDonald's would have figured it out it by the 1970's.  Making any profit (which they never ever will officially because then they would have to pay taxes... which none of them ever have) involves spending the absolute minimum on customer service.,/r/grubhub/comments/usrbvp/got_banned_from_being_able_to_place_orders/i9aaxtd/

Should people tip a reasonable amount given what is now pretty much common knowledge about tip jobs and how much the employees wage depends on said tips? Sure.

Does not tipping justify being nasty to the customer? No. Feel free to complain online or to your friends but harassing the customer without knowing anything about them is simply wrong regardless of how you feel about the job you do.

$9  should be more than enough for a maybe 15min ride if it over a bridge, through a clover-leaf, and through a tunnel @ rush hour. But there are some stores that I just won't serve because they're always a problem. They disrespect my time and interests.   


Here's what happened at one such place tonight:   


\- It took them almost 45 minutes to serve 5 customers (from the mic back to and including me)  
\- When I got to the window, they told me to pull up to the door cause they were waiting for fries.  
\- I waited another 10 minutes while they served 3 customers behind me  
\- I left my car and knocked on the window to ask them if they forgot about me. They acted like I was bothering them.  
\- A young worker came out, handed me 2 bags and told me not to come back  
\- The bags were not marked, so I went back to the window to ask which was which. They scolded me for bothering them while they're dealing with a customer. I was dealing with customers too and one of them was blowing up my inbox.  


\- The manager came outside to find out what the problem was. She opened what turned out to be Ashley's bag, broke the seals and told me that was Ashley's. She did not reseal the bags or mark them in any way.  


\- I asked her for Alex's drink and she went back in and made it  
I'm pretty sure both customers were happy enough, but Ashley may have been bothered by the broken seal. Customers cancel when orders are late and/or incomplete or incorrect or especially if it looks like the driver has been snacking on their fries on the way over. When that happens more than expected, I get an account violation labeled as ""suspected fraud"". 

I'm thinking your order is kicking around from one driver to the next till a new guy takes it. If your orders are getting reassigned to different drivers, likely the  new guy drove to the store, saw that it's a shit show, and then unassign themselves with penalty. (Too many of these will also draw an account violation, but sometimes you just have to). 

Then your order and generous tip get kicked back into the pool for the next sucker. The guy who delivered probably maybe broke $10/hr - expenses.  None of this is on you at all! 

My best advice is to order from small, locally-owned restaurants. Check their reviews. They pretty much all offer delivery through a few of the local apps these days.

Just curious why that is,"If the base pay or gratuity is too low it‚Äôll bounce around to different drivers being declined while they take higher paying deliveries. Most of the time that‚Äôs the reason and other times it‚Äôs simply be because the restaurant was running behind. Also, GrubHub was recently bought out by another company and they change the way they pay their drivers. It used to be for traveling let‚Äôs say 5 miles from the restaurant to the address, they would pay you around eight dollars and then you add on the tip it would turn out to be about $12-$15. Mind you that 5 miles was one way. Round-trip you‚Äôre talking 10 miles and probably a half hour of your time between the travel and waiting for the food to be ready. Now that GrubHub has new owners and the format has changed, we are lucky to get $2.50 before tip for a 5 mile one-way drive. It‚Äôs disappointing. I worked for DoorDash and GrubHub for two years, in March I added a third app called Spark. It‚Äôs grocery delivery for Walmart. Within three days of working for them I dropped the other two apps. I‚Äôve been picking up groceries that someone else has already shopped for, let‚Äôs say delivering them 5 miles, and getting paid anywhere between 30 and $40.

Just curious why that is,"Remember that when ordering from GrubHub you should base your tip more on the amount of time it takes your driver as well as the total miles driven as opposed to a percentage of the cost of your meal. It costs the drivers money to deliver a diner's food (not just gasoline, but time. While working for one diner drivers are passing up the opportunity to possibly work for more profitable diners). I realize it's impossible for you to know the exact miles it takes us to get to the restaurant, but you can know how far the restaurant is to your drop-off point. The same goes with time: there is no way of knowing for sure, but if you're ordering from McDonald's at 5:00 pm on a Friday the time is going to be considerably more than if you ordered from Subway on Tuesday at 8:00 pm. I say all this to let you know that most GH Drivers calculate whether they will accept an order or not on if they can complete the order in 30 minutes or less and make--bare minimum now that inflation is so bad---$1.00 a mile, usually more like $1.50. If your orders are consistently late my guess is that one of the three variables I mentioned isn't working for the driver, so they are rejecting your order when offered. You may need to adjust your tip amount, the proximity of the restaurant to your location, or the restaurant itself (like I said a McDonald's, etc during prime time is a bad idea).",/r/grubhub/comments/ujwjn9/anytime_i_schedule_food_for_a_certain_time_its/i7oms7g/

But odds are, you don‚Äôt live in the same state as me, so I‚Äôm going to go for it as I‚Äôm a firm believer in helping others!! So a bit of a back story first. Just before Covid hit my husband was diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs disease and a brain tumor. Instant lose of a 6 figure income (he was a crane operator). I quit my teaching job of 17 years to spend what time we had left, together. I needed work where I could bring him with me, so we started Doordashing. 3 months later we added GrubHub. Between the two apps working 6 days a week and piling on the miles to our new SUV we bought before his diagnosis, we would earn between $300-$700 per week (working 6 days). Like you, we took nothing under $1 per mile. The earnings range may sound odd, but we live near the beach. The low $ is off season and the high $ is on season. My husband fatigues easily and 6 days a week was beginning to take its toll on him, but we were always behind on bills and had no choice. My neighbor and friend, a manager at Walmart, told me about ‚ÄúSpark‚Äù on March 10th. It‚Äôs owned by Walmart and they have drivers deliver groceries that have already been shopped and paid for. I started with them March 17th. I simply park on the side of Walmart, and an associate comes out and puts them in my trunk. I drive to customers home and unload them, that‚Äôs it. You set your own days and hours. You can change or cancel them at any time without penalty. I average $4-$6 per mile!!! Without any exaggeration whatsoever I can honestly say that a typical order would be 4.6 miles for $42, or 2.1 miles for $18 or 6 miles for $27!! I‚Äôm not kidding! After 2 days working all 3 apps, I dropped DD AND GH! Last week I worked Thursday- Sunday from 11am- 3pm and then 5pm- 9pm and my check was $943!!! Previous weeks: )$809, $736, $591, $611, $913, etc. You should seriously consider doing Spark, it was the best decision I could‚Äôve made! Only working 4 days a week instead of 6, and making so much more!!! I‚Äôm so happy and relaxed now, such a beautiful change in our lives!! You should really check it out! It‚Äôs on the App Store.

However I‚Äôm going to give you a little known fact which of course is going to blow up all over Reddit. I did DoorDash and GrubHub as my sole means of income because I needed a job where I could bring my husband with me. He has a terminal brain tumor and Parkinson‚Äôs disease. In 2021 I made $27,500 with both of those apps working 5 days a week, 7 hours a day. A friend who works at Walmart told me I should try delivering groceries for a company called Spark that is owned by Walmart. An employee at the store shops for the items so all you‚Äôre doing is picking them up and bringing them to the customer. I added Spark with my other two apps on January 3. At the end of that first week I dropped DoorDash and GrubHub. I work the same schedule, 5 days a week, 7 hours a day and I already have earned just over 21k‚Ä¶ and only five months have passed. I‚Äôm earning over $1k a week including tips. At this rate I‚Äôll definitely make 50K, and perhaps even more. So watch your YouTube clips and do your homework before you make a decision to deliver with Doordash. And by the way you can also change your location anytime you want with Spark!

So, after waiting half an hour in line, driver has a choice. 1) Go through the process, call support, get in line again while driver support resends the order so the drive through worker can lie to them again when they get to the mic and then get paid about $2 for that hour or 2) mark it received, stop in front of your place for a minute, and mark it delivered.

When I get that treatment, I just cross that store off my list for awhile. I might check back in a month or so. Mean time I just reject all offers from that store ""I avoid this restaurant"".

Rn, I have one Popeye's, one Wendy's and one Taco Bell that I trust.

Did I do the right thing (explanation inside)?,"As a GH driver, I can assure you we still get paid. The incident could and should be investigated, and if a driver has many incidents like this, could be penalized. But...a lot of this also depends on the circumstances of the delays. 

Here are some scenarios that I have encountered a lot delivering for GH specifically (but less often on other platforms such as Doordash):

1. Some of the restaurants in my area refuse to start cooking the order until the driver gets to the restaurant. This results in a longer wait time for the driver. If the payout on the order is not worth the driver's time, he or she may unassign the order. So now the restaurant is cooking the order but GH needs to assign to another driver, who then has to drive to the restaurant and pick up the order.

2. If the customer hasn't tipped well in the order, the overall payout will be lower and it may take longer for GH to find a driver to accept the order. The difference in pay is usually made up for in mileage, so an order that may not be worth picking up for a driver nearby may be more appealing to one much farther away. These are the orders that I usually accept, and often have to drive quite far to get to the order which may have been started as soon as the order is placed.

3. GH may have assigned multiple orders to your driver, resulting in later delivery time.

4. The driver may be delivering for other platforms at the same time or basically goofing off.

All this to say that your order being severely late may or may not be the driver's fault at all. If it happens consistently, and you feel you are tipping well, I would consider ordering on another platform like Doordash or Uber Eats to see if you get quicker service.",/r/grubhub/comments/u9kdu4/i_just_filed_a_cold_food_complaint_and_apparently/i5sm5x0/
